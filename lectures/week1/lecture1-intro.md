# Week 1: Introduction to Natural Language Processing

## Lecture 1: Course Overview and NLP Applications

### Learning Objectives
- Understand what Natural Language Processing is and why it's important
- Survey major applications of NLP in industry and research
- Recognize the challenges that make NLP difficult
- Get familiar with the course structure and expectations

### What is Natural Language Processing?

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is the field of computer science concerned with the interactions between computers and human language. It sits at the intersection of:
- **Computer Science**: Algorithms and computational methods
- **Linguistics**: Understanding of language structure and meaning  
- **Machine Learning**: Data-driven approaches to learning patterns
- **Cognitive Science**: How humans process language

### Why is NLP Important?

#### The Data Explosion
- 90% of the world's data was created in the last 2 years
- Most of this data is unstructured text: emails, documents, social media, web pages
- Need automated tools to process and understand this information

#### Human-Computer Interaction
- Natural language is the most intuitive interface for humans
- Voice assistants, chatbots, and conversational AI are becoming ubiquitous
- Goal: Make computers understand and respond in natural language

### Major NLP Applications

#### 1. Machine Translation
- **Examples**: Google Translate, DeepL, Microsoft Translator
- **Challenge**: Preserving meaning across different language structures
- **Progress**: From rule-based → statistical → neural approaches

#### 2. Information Retrieval and Search
- **Examples**: Google Search, Bing, academic search engines
- **Tasks**: Query understanding, document ranking, snippet generation
- **Evolution**: Keyword matching → semantic understanding

#### 3. Question Answering
- **Examples**: Siri, Alexa, IBM Watson
- **Types**: Factoid QA, reading comprehension, open-domain QA
- **Applications**: Customer service, education, research assistance

#### 4. Sentiment Analysis
- **Examples**: Social media monitoring, product reviews, market research
- **Levels**: Document, sentence, aspect-based sentiment
- **Business Impact**: Brand monitoring, customer feedback analysis

#### 5. Text Summarization
- **Types**: Extractive (selecting important sentences) vs. Abstractive (generating new text)
- **Applications**: News summarization, document processing, email digests
- **Challenges**: Maintaining coherence and factual accuracy

#### 6. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- **Task**: Identify and classify entities (people, places, organizations)
- **Applications**: Information extraction, knowledge graph construction
- **Domains**: News, biomedical texts, legal documents

#### 7. Dialogue Systems
- **Types**: Task-oriented vs. open-domain chatbots
- **Examples**: Customer service bots, virtual assistants
- **Components**: Natural language understanding, dialogue management, generation

### Why is NLP Hard?

#### 1. Ambiguity
- **Lexical**: "bank" (financial institution vs. river bank)
- **Syntactic**: "I saw the man with the telescope"
- **Semantic**: "The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak" → "The vodka is good but the meat is rotten" (machine translation error)

#### 2. Context Dependence
- Meaning depends on context: "It's hot" (temperature vs. stolen goods)
- Anaphora resolution: "John went to the store. He bought milk." (what does "he" refer to?)

#### 3. Variability
- **Linguistic**: Different ways to express the same meaning
- **Cultural**: Language varies across regions and communities
- **Temporal**: Language evolves over time

#### 4. Implicit Knowledge
- Humans rely on world knowledge and common sense
- "The trophy doesn't fit in the suitcase because it's too big"
- What is "too big"? The trophy or the suitcase?

#### 5. Creativity and Figurative Language
- Metaphors: "Time is money"
- Sarcasm: "Great, another meeting" 
- Neologisms: New words constantly entering language

### Brief History of NLP

#### 1950s-1960s: Early Beginnings
- **1950**: Turing Test proposed
- **1954**: Georgetown-IBM experiment (automatic translation)
- **Rule-based approaches**: Hand-crafted grammars and dictionaries

#### 1970s-1980s: Linguistic Approaches
- **Chomsky's influence**: Formal grammars and syntax trees
- **Expert systems**: Hand-coded linguistic knowledge
- **Limited success**: Brittle systems, narrow domains

#### 1990s-2000s: Statistical Revolution
- **Corpus linguistics**: Learning from large text collections
- **Machine learning**: Statistical models replace hand-coded rules
- **Evaluation metrics**: Standardized benchmarks and competitions

#### 2010s: Deep Learning Era
- **Neural networks**: End-to-end learning
- **Word embeddings**: Distributed representations (Word2Vec, GloVe)
- **Sequence models**: RNNs, LSTMs for sequential data

#### 2017-Present: Transformer Era
- **Attention mechanism**: "Attention is All You Need"
- **Pre-trained models**: BERT, GPT, T5
- **Large language models**: Scaling up parameters and data
