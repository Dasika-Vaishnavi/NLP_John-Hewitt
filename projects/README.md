## Project Options

### Option 1: Research Project
Investigate a novel approach to an existing NLP problem or explore a new application domain.

**Examples**:
- Bias detection in language models for specific communities
- Cross-lingual transfer learning for low-resource languages
- Multimodal NLP combining text and images

## Tips for Success

### Start Early
- Begin exploring topics during the proposal phase
- Set up development environment early
- Start with simple baselines before complex models

### Scope Appropriately
- Better to do something simple well than something complex poorly
- Focus on one clear research question or application
- Plan for unexpected challenges and debugging time

### Document Everything
- Keep detailed notes on experiments and results
- Version control your code from the beginning
- Write documentation as you code, not at the end

### Seek Feedback
- Use office hours to discuss ideas and get guidance
- Present preliminary results to get early feedback
- Don't wait until the last minute to ask for help
